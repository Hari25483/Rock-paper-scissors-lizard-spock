In this video clip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8) from the famous TV show
The Big Bang Theory, the character Dr. Sheldon Cooper explains a popular game of chance
“Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock” to the character Dr. Barry Kripke. Since Barry is slow
and cannot decide the winner quickly, he wants a computer program to decide who the winner is. If you are as slow or slower than Barry in following Sheldon, you may read this page
